# ML-Course-Project

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, etc.)

## Steps

### 1. Clone the repository

Download or clone this repository. Make sure to save it in a directory on your local machine where you can easily access it.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the notebook. Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly xgboost lightgbm jupyter
```
Install any other packages if required.

### 3. Launch Jupyter Notebook

Once the dependencies are installed, launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new tab in your web browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface.

### 4. Open the Notebook

Navigate to the directory where you cloned/saved the Kaggle notebook and open it by clicking on its filename.

### 5. Update File Paths (if necessary)

If the notebook uses datasets or files with specific file paths that are not available on your local machine, you may need to update these paths to point to the correct locations. Edit the notebook cells as needed to reflect the file paths on your machine.

### 6. Run the Notebook

Run the notebook cells one by one or all at once to execute the code.
